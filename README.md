# Harris Challenge 1: Analysis of Divvy Bikeshare Supply and Demand

This short project was the first in a series of optional challenge problems offered to students taking Data Analysis for Public Policy I 
at the University of Chicago's Harris School of Public Policy. It uses data from Divvy bike stations to analyze the supply and demand 
for Divvy bikes using python. For this work, I was acknowledged as among the "Superstars" who completed the challenge:
